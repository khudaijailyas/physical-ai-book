# Introduction to Physical AI

Physical AI combines **robotics**, **artificial intelligence**, and **human interaction** to create intelligent systems capable of operating in the real world.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Robotics Integration
Sensors, actuators, and AI software work together to perform complex tasks.

### 2. Intelligent Agents
Software agents that can **learn, adapt, and make decisions** autonomously.

### 3. Human-Robot Interaction
Designing systems so robots **communicate safely and effectively** with humans.
