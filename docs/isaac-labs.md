# Practical Labs & Examples

## Learning Objectives
- Apply knowledge of Isaac Sim and AI control in labs.
- Perform hands-on simulations and tests.
- Analyze results and optimize robot behavior.

## Concept Explanation
Labs allow students to practice in controlled virtual environments. Tasks include navigation, object manipulation, sensor calibration, and AI planning. Isaac Sim provides a realistic testbed to implement these labs safely.

## Why This Matters
Hands-on labs consolidate learning and build confidence. Students can experiment freely without risk of damaging real robots.

## Example
Students simulate a delivery robot navigating an office environment, avoiding obstacles, and dropping packages at designated locations.

## Practical Notes
- Start labs with pre-configured environments.
- Document all observations for report submission.
- Gradually increase task complexity as skills improve.

## Summary
Practical labs reinforce theory and enable students to gain real experience with AI-powered robots in simulation environments.
